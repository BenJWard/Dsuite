#  Dsuite
Fast calculation of D-statistics and related admixture evidence directly from VCF files.

## Compilation

To compile you must have a reasonably recent GCC or clang compiler (on mac OS this comes with Command Line Tools) and the zlib compression library (https://www.zlib.net). Both should already be present on most systems. 


Then simply change directories into the Dsuite folder, and type:
`make`
The Dsuite executable will be in the Build folder.

## Input files:
1. Bialllelic variants in a VCF file. The fille can be gzipped.
